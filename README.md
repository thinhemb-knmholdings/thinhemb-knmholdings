- 👋 Hi there, I’m @thinhemb-knmholdings
- 👀 I’m interested in leveraging AI and ML, particularly in **Deep Learning**, **NLP**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Generative AI**, to build intelligent applications. Also passionate about **MLOps** principles.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring advanced **LLM techniques** (like fine-tuning, RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation), diving deeper into **MLOps practices** (CI/CD for ML, monitoring), and experimenting with **multimodal AI**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source AI/ML projects**, especially those involving **NLP, LLMs, or practical MLOps solutions**. I'm also open to projects applying AI to solve real-world problems.
- 📫 How to reach me: **thinhdo@knmholdings.vn** or connect with me on **[Link LinkedIn Profile của bạn (tùy chọn)]**. Feel free to open an issue or discussion on my repositories too!
